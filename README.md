# mcp-proxy



The MCP Proxy is a middleware service that facilitates communication between client applications and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It acts as an intermediary layer that supports multiple transport mechanisms and routes client requests to appropriate backend MCP servers. This document provides a high-level overview of the MCP Proxy system architecture, components, and functionality.
